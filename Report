🧩 1. Define the Problem

-The company is experiencing uneven mobile sales performance across regions, brands, and months.
-Despite having strong overall revenue, some brands and cities consistently underperform, and sales fluctuate heavily month-to-month.
-The dashboard exists to help management identify sales gaps, weak regions, and underperforming product segments.

🧩 2. State the Goal

The goal of the dashboard is to:
-Track overall mobile sales performance.
-Compare brand-wise, city-wise, and month-wise revenue and quantity sold.
-Identify top-selling models and low-performing segments.
-Support data-driven decisions to improve profitability and inventory planning.

🧩 3. Explain Only Important KPIs / Visuals

-Total Revenue & Total Quantity Sold – to measure business performance.
-Sales by Brand / Model – to identify best and worst performers.
-Sales by City / Region – to detect geographical demand patterns.
-Monthly Sales Trend – to observe seasonality and demand fluctuations.
-Payment Mode / Customer Type (if available) – to understand buying behavior.
-These visuals focus management attention on where money is earned and where it is being lost.

🧩 4. Identify the Root Cause

The analysis shows that:
-A small number of brands and models contribute the majority of revenue, while several products generate very low sales.
-Certain cities/regions consistently underperform, indicating weak market penetration or poor local promotions.
-Monthly trends show sales drops in specific periods, suggesting seasonality, stock issues, or ineffective campaigns.
-The core problem is inefficient product and regional focus, leading to wasted marketing budget and missed revenue opportunities.

🧩 5. Provide a Data-Backed Action Plan

To improve sales performance, the business should:
-Prioritize top-selling brands and models by increasing stock availability and promotional campaigns.
-Revise strategy for low-performing cities through localized offers, better distribution, or targeted digital ads.
-Optimize inventory planning using monthly trend insights to prevent stock-outs and over-stocking.
-Discontinue or reprice weak products that consistently show low contribution.
-Use the dashboard monthly to monitor KPIs and adjust marketing spend dynamically instead of relying on assumptions.
